#### Superstore 2016 
 
I imported the superstore 2016 xlxs into powerbi.
I created new table called DateTime and inserted function 
DateTime = ADDCOLUMNS(CALENDAR(MIN(Orders[Order Date]), MAX(Orders[Order Date])), "Day", DAY([Date]), "Month", FORMAT([Date],"MMM"), "Year", FORMAT([Date],"YYYY"))
For defining date month year from order date
I added New column called deliver days 
Deliver Days = DATEDIFF( Orders[Order Date],Orders[Ship Date],DAY)


After that I inserted textbox and Write that Superstore and sales analysis  for just heading purpose
I inserted few cards  from visualization in dash board and format that cards like changing the background opacity and color of fonts to white
1)Sales
2)Profit 
3)Quality 
Then I added two slicer for order date and ship date and also change their backgground opacity to 100 and resize the boxes to set to the dashboard.
Then I added map visualization and  put stare in location and put country in legend and format it like map setting I choose dark and choose title off and tooltips on for the map.
Then I added donut chart and put segment in legend and sales in values and also formatted this by background transparency 100 and title to mid and tooltip on.
Then I added Pie chart and put region in legend and sales in values and also formatted this by background transparency 100 and title to mid and tooltip on.
Now I wanted some different type of visualization so I went to more visualization  ans explore there.
I found 2 interesting  sunburst visualization and scroller visualization so I downloaded that.
In sunburst , you can add groups like category and subcategory for visualization and put values in sales. And format  the visualization like transparent background and title to centre 
After that I inserted scroller and explore the scroller . I liked it because it is auto scrolling and its like we can see it in share market in scroller I put Subcategory to category and sales to absolute value but it didnâ€™t give me green or red markers so I change sales to measure deviation
After that I set dashboard and format canvas background to black and change some graphs font colour because it was to good at visualizing 
After that I inserted textbox and Write that Superstore | Profit analysis  for just heading purpose

Now I inserted a new page and rename it to profit analysis. I inserted few cards  from visualization in dash board and format that cards like changing the background opacity and color of fonts to white
1)Sales
2)Profit 
3)Quality 
After that I added slicer for selecting individual states.
And added data table for subcategory and region to columns and profits to the value. Now we can select subcategory region vies for profit
Now I added 3 donut charts for profit for region , segment, category for visualization and format that  according to previous one.
Then I added stacked bar chart for profit for subcategory and formatted .
I want line graph for year wise profit so I added line chart and in axis I added order date and profit in values. And I formatted this little bit and I explore that there is one option called  drill down and  I got the chart year and quarter wise profit
I inserted scroller to category wise profit and make some adjustment  to the canvas and settle it.
